# 🧪 Pharmacy Inventory Optimization (Kareema Medical Store)

This project was developed as part of the IITM BDM Capstone and focuses on real-world pharmaceutical inventory challenges faced by Kareema Medical Store, a local pharmacy in Uttar Pradesh, India. The aim was to optimize stock levels, reduce wastage, and improve profitability using Python, Excel, and forecasting techniques.

## 🎯 Project Objective
- Identify demand concentration and stockout patterns
- Forecast medicine demand using ARIMA(6,1,6)
- Classify SKUs using ABC analysis
- Reduce waste from zero-revenue and overstocked SKUs

## 📈 Key Achievements
- Prevented 73% stockouts using forecasting
- Identified ₹4.6L locked in non-performing inventory
- Scored **99/100** in final viva for business impact and analytical depth

## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries
- Python 3.9, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Statsmodels
- Microsoft Excel, Pivot Charts
- PDF parsing with PyPDF2

## 📁 Repository Structure
